# Brief Description
- USing gzip/gunzip we uncompress the file and then and then add permission to execute the file using chmod.
- Next we grep for keywords (in this case pico) after using the strings function as just using strings will output a lot of unnecessary information.
- Then we obtain the flag: picoCTF{1t5_ju5t_4_5tr1n9_be6031da}
